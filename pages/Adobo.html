    <h2><em>Key Ingredients in Filipino Adobo</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Chicken</strong></p>
            <p>I’m partial to chicken drumsticks in my Filipino adobo 
                (it’s how I mostly ate it when I was growing up), 
                but it’s equally great with bone-in chicken thighs. 
                You can go all in on one or the other, or use a mix. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Seasonings</strong></p>
            <p>Garlic, dried bay leaves, and whole 
                black peppercorns form the flavorful 
                foundation of this dish. I call for 5 
                cloves of garlic here, but it’s really 
                just a starting point. The same goes for 
                the bay leaves and black peppercorns — 
                you can always add in more. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Soy Sauce</strong></p>
            <p>The addition of soy sauce makes this version of adobo 
                (known as Adobong Itim or black adobo) the one most people 
                are familiar with. I keep Silver Swan soy sauce, a Filipino 
                brand, on hand primarily for making adobo. It’s thinner in body, 
                darker in color, and tastes just like home.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Vinegar</strong></p>
            <p>Similar to my preference in soy sauce, I recommend using cane 
                vinegar when making adobo. It’s the most commonly used vinegar 
                in the Philippines. Made from fermented sugarcane syrup, its 
                mild flavor perfectly complements the adobo </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Filipino Adobo</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Sear the chicken.</strong> Pat your choice 
                of meat dry with paper towels, season with salt, 
                then sear in a Dutch oven (or large heavy-bottomed pot) 
                until browned all over. Transfer chicken to a plate.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Make the adobo.</strong> Toast garlic cloves, dried bay 
                leaves, and whole peppercorns in the residual oil, then add water, 
                soy sauce, cane vinegar, and oyster sauce, scraping any brown 
                bits on the bottom. Return chicken to the pot and simmer until 
                cooked through.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Broil the chicken.</strong> Place the chicken on a 
                foil-lined baking sheet and broil until browned. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Serve with rice.</strong> Pile rice onto a plate, 
                add a chicken piece or two, then drench everything with sauce. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2><em>Helpful Swaps</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>You can substitute rice vinegar or distilled white vinegar 
            for the cane vinegar. The flavor profile won’t be quite the same, 
            but it’ll be delicious nonetheless. 
        </em></li>
        <li><em>Try swapping in cubed pork shoulder or pork belly, or baby back 
            ribs (like my mom does), for the chicken. Take note that you will 
            need to simmer the meat in the pot covered, and extend the cooking 
            time as needed to ensure that the pork is tender. Once tender, 
            remove the pork from the pot (broil it if you like), and continue 
            to simmer the sauce uncovered to reduce it. 
        </em></li>
        <li><em>To keep it gluten-free, use tamari in place of soy sauce. 
        </em></li>
