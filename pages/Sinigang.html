    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Pork</strong></p>
            <p>while you can use meatier and leaner parts such as pork shoulder 
                (kasim), I recommend bony cuts such as spare ribs, pork belly 
                with ribs, hocks, knuckles, and tailbone or neck bones for 
                better flavor. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Tomatoes</strong></p>
            <p>use ripe, juicy tomatoes </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Onion</strong></p>
            <p>peeled and quartered </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Fish sauce</strong></p>
            <p>brings umami flavor; you can swap it with salt if you prefer </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Gabi</strong></p>
            <p>adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Radish</strong></p>
            <p>(labanos)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Fish sauce</strong></p>
            <p>brings umami flavor; you can swap it with salt if you prefer </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Vegetables</strong></p>
            <p>the recipe uses sitaw (long beans), eggplant, okra, and bok choy, 
                but feel free to include other local produce available such as 
                kangkong (water spinach) and pechay</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Tamarind</strong></p>
            <p>can be fresh pods, paste, or powder mixes</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Banana or finger chili peppers (siling haba)</strong></p>
            <p>adds a mild heat; optional and can be omitted</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make from scratch</h2>
    <p>I usually use packaged tamarind mixes as the 
        fresh fruit is not always available in my area. 
        Although these powder flavorings are easy and convenient to use, 
        nothing beats pork sinigang from scratch! Just follow the steps 
        below on how to use green tamarind pods.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Wash tamarind pods under cold, running water to remove 
                any grit or dirt from the skins. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place in a saucepan with about 1 cup water and bring to a boil. 
                Cook for about 4 to 5 minutes until soft, and the outer skins 
                begin to burst.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Using a fork, mash the tamarinds to release the pulp.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place the tamarind and liquid in a fine-mesh strainer set over a
                 bowl. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid 
                 into the strainer once or twice to fully extract the juice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot.</p>
              
    </ol>
    <h2><em>Cooking tips</em></h2>
    <p>For a clearer broth, you can parboil the meat. Bring to a boil, drain, 
        and discard liquid. Rinse the meat and pot well and continue cooking 
        with fresh cold water. Tend to the soup regularly by removing scum that 
        accumulates on top.</p>
    <h2><em>How to serve and store</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Pork sinigang is delicious on its own or with steamed rice. 
            For the complete experience, serve it with fish sauce and chili 
            peppers on the side for dipping.
        </em></li>
        <li><em>Store leftovers in a container with a tight-
            fitting lid and refrigerate for up to 3 days. 
        </em></li>
        <li><em>Reheat in a saucepot to an internal temperature of 165 F 
            or in the microwave at 2 to 3-minute intervals until completely 
            warmed through, stirring well after each interval to distribute 
            heat.
        </em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enjoy this delicious pork sour soup, and keep warm, my friends!</p>
